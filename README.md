This is project created by a group of Code Institute students/alumna for the [October Halloween Hackathon](https://hackathon.codeinstitute.net/hackathon/38/).

By employing Agile principles, we prioritized collaboration, adaptability, and iterative progress. We did this by regular meetings, continuous communication on slack and making use of the project board on Github with Epics, user stories and issues.
