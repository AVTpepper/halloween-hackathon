## Introduction

**Spooky story creation**
is an website that generates scary stories with OpenAI. Stories are tailored to the the users preferred specifications. 

This is project created by a group of Code Institute students/alumna for the [October Halloween Hackathon](https://hackathon.codeinstitute.net/hackathon/38/).

### Agile Methodology

Our team successfully implemented the Agile Methodology throughout the development process of the website. By employing Agile principles, we prioritized collaboration, adaptability, and iterative progress. We did this by regular meetings, continuous communication on slack and making use of the project board on Github with Epics, user stories and issues.

Our Github projects board during development:
